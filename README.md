# FuckTheCube
My first blender addon

Entirely made for a meme. Also some decent practice for future projects. 

0.1 is the first version. 

Bow on 0.1.5. Now deletes all objects if they have "Cube" in the name. Capitalization doesn't matter. 

In the next version will add one to delete all objects that look like a cube aka have 8 vertices, 6 faces and 12 edges.  after that I'll probably stop making this.


#Note: I might turn this into something useful later. Idk what though yet.
