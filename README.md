# FuckTheCube
My first blender addon

Entirely made for a meme. Also some decent practice for future projects. 

0.1 is the first version. 

In 0.2 I'll add an option to delete all objects starting with "Cube" such as Cube.001 or Cube_QWERTY or whatever.

In 0.3 will add one to delete all objects that look like a cube aka have 8 vertices, 6 faces and 12 edges.  after that I'll probably stop making this.
